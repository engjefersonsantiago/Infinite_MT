The P4 language and modern programmable dataplanes have redrawn the networking landscape by allowing full data path programming in SDN environments.
P4 offers an explicit imperative match-action-based programming model which is the main processing abstraction in programmable dataplanes.
However, modern programmable dataplanes lack the memory capacity to implement large match tables.
Recent research has suggested mixing up different programmable dataplane devices to increase memory capacity.

This work presents a cache hierarchy scheme in heterogeneous programmable dataplanes to emulate a single "virtually infinite" match table.
Thus, we start our analysis by characterizing an up-to-date data center trace.
Then, following our observations, we derive the caching premises for match-action caching.
Finally, we develop an open-source simulator to evaluate the viability of our proposed caching scheme.
