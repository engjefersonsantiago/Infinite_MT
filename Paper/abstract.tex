The P4 language and modern programmable dataplanes have redrawn the networking landscape by allowing full data path programming in SDN environments.
P4 offers an explicit imperative match-action-based programming model, which is the main processing abstraction in programmable dataplanes.
However, modern programmable dataplanes lack the memory capacity to implement large match tables.
% Faut-il préciser que l on considere ASIC + autres targets?
Recent research has suggested to use heterogeneous programmable dataplanes, comprising different programmable data planes, to increase the memory capacity. 
However, the bandwidth supported by an heterogeneous programmable dataplane is limited by the slowest programmable data plane. 
% Il faudrait clarifier que le devices avec le plus de mémoire est celui le plus lent.

To address this issue, this work presents a cache hierarchy scheme for heterogeneous programmable dataplanes that allows to implement large match tables, while supporting a high packet troughput. 
We start our analysis by characterizing a recent data center trace.
Then, following our observations, we derive the caching premises for match-action caching.
Finally, we develop an open-source simulator to evaluate the viability of our proposed caching scheme.
