\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

P4 and the PISA architecture are bringing a new meaning to programmable networks as they promote data plane programming.
Although current PISA-based programmable dataplanes offer a high throughput, they lack in memory resources for implementing P4 applications.
Thus, recent research suggested that heterogeneous to confront the memory/performance trade-off.
However, no assumptions heterogeneous match table caching have yet been proposed.

In this work, we presented a cache hierarchy for HDPs.
We analyzed real-world data center network traces to derive caching premises.
Based on our observations, we proposed new traffic-aware cache eviction and promotion policies.
These new policies, alongside classic ones, were evaluated in the context of HDPs.
Simulation results show a size weighted hit ratio approaching to 90\% when HDP-realistic cache policies (Random+WMFU) are used.
In addition, the theoretical OWLFU eviction policy outperforms other policies when no promotion policy is implemented.
This may motivate future research on approximating OWLFU targeting data plane realization.
