\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

P4 and the PISA architecture are bringing a new meaning to programmable networks as they promote data plane programming.
Although current PISA-based programmable dataplanes offer high throughput, they lack memory resources for implementing P4 applications.
Thus, recent research proposed heterogeneous dataplanes to confront the memory/performance trade-off.
However, the problem heterogeneous match table caching has not yet been addressed.

In this work, we presented a cache hierarchy for HDPs.
We analyzed real-world data center network traces to derive caching premises.
Based on our observations, we proposed new traffic-aware cache eviction and promotion policies.
These new policies, alongside classic ones, were evaluated in the context of HDPs.
Simulation results show a size weighted hit ratio approaching 90\% when HDP-realistic cache policies (Random+WMFU) are used.
Moreover, the OWLFU eviction policy outperforms other policies when no promotion policy is implemented.
This may motivate future research on approximating OWLFU targeting data plane realization.
